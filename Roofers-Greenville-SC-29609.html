But you might, with some skill and a lot of patience, be able to make a small repair on your roof.<BR>The first step would be to actually locate the leak.  We’ll give you some tips here to help you find your leak without having to climb a ladder and walk around on the roof.<BR>Sometimes, what you consider a roof leak might actually be moisture or humidity in your house.  We’ll talk about how to know the difference in a condensation problem inside, and a leaky roof.<BR>Leaky Roof vs. Moisture or Condensation<BR><BR>First, if you see stains on your ceiling, make note if there are several small stains, or if you’re seeing one big area that is discolored or stained.  The many smaller stains possibly indicate a condensation issue.  They will, no doubt, be closer to your exterior walls, and you’ll see them, even if the weather is dry and there hasn’t been rain in a while.<BR>Secondly…is there a white center to the stain?  This is another prime indication of an inside moisture problem rather than a roof leak. Water condensation can create a mold problem that may or may not be readily apparent.  If you feel this is what you’re dealing with, call a water restoration specialist to help you know for certain.<BR><BR>If your roof is leaking, the stain could appear <a href="https://xka4z.app.goo.gl/GPQp">roofing repair anderson sc</a> anywhere, not just close to the walls, as in the previous example. The center of this kind of stain will be darker in the middle and will get lighter the farther away from the center you look.  That’s because the center of a  stain caused by a leaking roof is older because that’s where the leak started.<BR>Is Your Ceiling Sagging?<BR><BR>The biggest reason a ceiling will sag is rain water that has collected into a pool on the ceiling.  If your ceiling remains wet, it will break down the ceiling material, and it will become even more soaked and will weaken to the point where it is sagging. Before attempting to repair your roof, the water should be drained totally. This can be accomplished by making a small hole in the wet area, and letting the water drain into a container.<BR><BR>Is Your Paint or Wallpaper Peeling?<BR>Wallpaper that is coming loose from the wall or peeling paint are indications of a roof leak.  Especially telling is when the paint is peeling on an inner wall instead of an exterior wall.<BR>Look for Mold<BR><BR>The presence of mold can be a sure sign of a roof leak or condensation.  Take a look around the vents and chimneys because mold is likely to appear here first. An underlying cause of mold is usually a leak in the flashing of a metal roof.  Metal roof leaks are easier to diagnose than a roof made with shingles or tiles.<BR><BR>Once you have evidence of a leak, you can then more easily trace it back to the source, and get a good <a href="https://www.beemerkangaroof.com/roof-inspections/">roof repair in Greer sc</a> idea of where the roof leak is on the outside.  Having the architectural drawings or plans for your house can be a big help in locating the possible leak.<BR>If your roof is made with shingles or tiles, fixing the leak can be a fairly straightforward process.  For a tile roof, in most cases, the leak is from damaged or cracked tiles. Then, you will simply need to have the tiles replaced, and then the new tiles should be sealed with roof cement.<BR>In the case of a metal roof, you will need to locate the leak and then seal it with either roof cement or caulk.<BR>If locating and fixing a roof leak is not your “thing,” contact a roofing professional.<BR><strong><center>Beemer Kangaroof <BR>3208A Old Buncombe Rd. <BR>Greenville, SC 29609<BR>(864) 412-2573</center></strong>This is the safest and best way to solve those unexpected leaks.<BR><br><br><center><BR><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3272.9167410316168!2d-82.42329968476284!3d34.88343698038798!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8858318589f9e77b%3A0xdbbf20a3ba3b30ca!2sBeemer+Kangaroof!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1529412136676" width="880" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><BR><iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=pbeb2s5tc2jfaifr4d5umkasdo@group.calendar.google.com"  width="900" height="20" frameborder="0" style="border:0" ></iframe></center><p><a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Contractors Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Contractor Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roof Repair Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roof Repair Greenville</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Repair Greenville</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Repair Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roof Replacement Greenville</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roof Replacement Contractor Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roof Replacement Company Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Company Greenville</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Contractor Greenville SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roof Repair In Greer SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofing Repair Anderson SC</a><br> <a href="http://beemerkangaroof.com ">Roofers Greenville</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
